 * token-scale and theme-sync guards, button.test.tsx's focus-ring contrast
 * guard). Matches each innermost `selector { declarations-without-nested-braces }`
 * pair. An @media/@keyframes wrapper's own `{` never closes before hitting
 * the nested rule's `{`, so `[^{}]*` fails to match it and the wrapper is
 * skipped on its own — only real declaration blocks come out of this.
 * Comments are stripped first: otherwise the "selector" capture (which runs
 * back to the previous `}`) swallows whatever comment precedes the rule, and
 * prose mentioning a dotted filename (`theme.css`, `tokens.test.ts`) parses
 * as a bogus leading class.
