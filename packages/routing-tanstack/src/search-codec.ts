// Search-string decode/parse/build — the one codec this package's every
// caller shares for TanStack's own `?a=b&c=d`-shaped search string, kept in
// its own module so no second caller can carry a near-verbatim copy of the
// parse without the malformed-input guard below. `virtual-location.ts`'s
// own history-adaptation codec and `location-preserving-redirect.ts`'s own
// redirect-search builder both import from here rather than each parsing
// this string on their own.
//
// Not the navigation substrate's own grammar codec — that codec encodes the
// composed-application URL's entry syntax (ADR 0003), a structurally
// different grammar from TanStack's own query-string surface, which every
// caller of this module treats as opaque and never re-parses beyond generic
// `name=value` splitting (FEATURE (engine-provider) §3, step 1: "this
// package's own adapter treats as an opaque string").
//
// Internal to this package: no caller outside `packages/routing-tanstack`
// needs a search string in this shape directly, so none of this module's
// exports appear on `src/index.ts` (DESIGN §3.3, API Contracts).

/**
 * `decodeURIComponent` throws `URIError` on a bare `%` or any other
 * malformed percent-escape — a real possibility for a page's own query
 * string, which this adapter never controls (a hand-typed URL, a bookmark
 * from an older version of the app, a third party's own link). Letting that
 * throw escape a caller here would fail the whole adaptation at
 * construction over one bad pair; falling back to the raw, still-encoded
 * text for that one pair keeps every other pair intact and keeps
 * construction total, mirroring the navigation substrate's own grammar
 * parse, which never throws on a malformed token either — it downgrades to
 * a warning instead (`ParseWarningCode`, 'malformed-entry'). This adapter
 * has no warning channel of its own to report through, so it keeps the raw
 * text rather than dropping the pair outright: a raw, still-percent-encoded
 * value is still a usable (if unlovely) string for whatever reads it next,
 * where dropping it would silently lose a parameter the URL visibly still
 * carries.
 *
 * The raw text does not stay raw indefinitely: `buildSearchString` runs
 * every value through `encodeURIComponent` on the next write regardless of
 * where it came from, so a value kept raw here because it failed to decode
 * is re-encoded on that write like any other — a bare `%` becomes `%25`,
 * for instance. The URL's own text changes without this adapter raising a
 * signal of its own (DESIGN §3.3, "Virtual location").
