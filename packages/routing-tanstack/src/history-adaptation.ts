// History Adaptation To The RouterHistory Contract
// `cpt-frontx-algo-routing-engine-provider-history-adaptation`.
//
// Adapts the navigation substrate's shared `NavigationHistory` — together
// with a `VirtualLocationSource` that knows how to read and write one
// occupant's own virtual location — into an object satisfying
// `@tanstack/history`'s own `RouterHistory` contract.
//
// `VirtualLocationSource` is this file's own seam, not a FEATURE-defined
// shape: the algorithm's own step 1 delegates "when running standalone" to
// a *different* algorithm
// (`cpt-frontx-algo-routing-engine-provider-standalone-deployment`) that
// projects a virtual location from the page's own address rather than from
// one entry — the composed and standalone cases share every derivation
// this file performs (steps 2 onward) and differ only in where a virtual
// location is read from and written to. This seam is what lets both
// sources reuse this file's own derivation without duplicating it;
// `./composed-history-source.js` and `./standalone-history-source.js` are
// the two concrete sources this package implements.
